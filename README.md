# BandsInTown
This project attempts to illustrates where a particular artist is touring. 
This application uses React.js and react-leaflet, which is a great way to embed Leaflet 
maps as React components.    
Also, this project utilizes the Bands In Town API in order to retrieve touring locations for an artist, which is used to be rendered as markers on the map.
